# Data sets
This repository contains the data sets of the paper "Allocation of spinning reserves in autonomous grids considering frequency stability constraints and short-term solar power variations" authored by Erick F. Alves, Louis Polleux, Gilles Guerassimoff, Magnus Korp√•s, Elisabetta Tedeschi. With these files, it is possible to reproduce most simulations and results obtained in the paper.

# Folder organization
- Results: files containing the final results described in the paper and values of intermediate steps. 
- Solar convex hulls: hourly convex hulls obtained using the procedure detailed in Appendix A from high-resolution irradiance timeseries provided by NREL.
- Solar irradiance profiles: high-resolution irradiance timeseries for the worst-case ramp scenarios used for simulations in MATLAB Simulink.
