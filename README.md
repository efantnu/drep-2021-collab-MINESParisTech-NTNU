# Data sets
This repository contains the data sets and time-domain simulation models of the paper "Allocation of spinning reserves in autonomous grids considering frequency stability constraints and short-term solar power variations" authored by Erick F. Alves, Louis Polleux, Gilles Guerassimoff, Magnus Korp√•s, Elisabetta Tedeschi. With these files, it is possible to reproduce most simulations and results obtained in the paper.

# Folder organization
- Results: final results and values of intermediate steps of the optimization model implemented in Gurobi 9.1 and described in section III-A and III-B of the paper. 
- Validation: test system implemented in OpenModelica for validation of the results and described in section III-C of paper.  
- Solar convex hulls: hourly convex hulls obtained using the procedure detailed in Appendix A.
- Solar irradiance profiles: high-resolution irradiance timeseries from NREL used to identify the worst-case solar PV ramp scenarios.
