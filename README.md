# Data sets
This repository contains the data sets of the paper "Allocation of spinning reserves for autonomous grids subject to frequency stability constraints and short-term renewable power variations" authored by Louis Polleux, Erick F. Alves, Magnus Korp{\aa}s, Elisabetta Tedeschi, and Gilles Guerassimoff. With these files, it is possible to reproduce most simulations and results obtained in the paper.

# Folder organization
- Results: files containing the final results described in the paper and values of intermediate steps. 
- Solar convex hulls: hourly convex hulls obtained using the procedure detailed in Appendix A from high-resolution irradiance timeseries provided by NREL.
- Solar irradiance profiles: high-resolution irradiance timeseries for the worst-case ramp scenarios used for simulations in MATLAB Simulink.
